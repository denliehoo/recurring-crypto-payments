# Database

- Go to mongodb atlas to create an account: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
- Create a cluster
- Create an admin account during cluster creation (if havent) and assign it to the account
- In that cluster dashboard, click CONNECT -> choose MongoDB for VS Code -> you'll see what is the connection string there (e.g. mongodb+srv://usernamehere:password@yourclusterdetails.mongodb.net/)
- copy that connection string and replace password with the password you created for the admin account and place it in your envrionment variabls
- Go back to the atlas dashboard -> scroll down on the side bar to security -> choose network access
- Add this IP Address: 0.0.0.0/0 ; this will allow access from any IP address. By default, only the IP address of which you created the admin account will be there and this is for a security reason. Without allowing access from all IP addresses, when your server is deployed, you'll run into errors.

# Server deployment

Server deployment is done using Render

- https://dashboard.render.com/
- New > Web Service
- Connect to github repository
- Build & Deploy settings:
  - Branch: main
  - Root directory: server
  - build command: npm install [ensure that it has server/ before it]
  - start command: npm start [ensure server/ before it]
  - auto-deploy: no [can be yes if want]
- Add environmental values that are already in the server. In addition add this environmental value:
  - NODE_VERSION=22.14.0
- Deploy it and wait
- To redeploy: push commit to github, click on manual deploy on the webserver > deploy latest commit > wait and done

# AWS Cron

- Go to AWS Lambda > Functions > Create Function and call the API [Code below]
- In function > function overview > click add trigger > select EventBridge
- Create new rule > Schedule Expression > Schedule Expression: rate(1 hour) [basically one every hour] > Done
- If want to edit/end: go to the lambda function > click on the EventBridge > Select the Trigger (in Configurations tab) > click on the create schedule api > edit and save accordingly

```Javascript
import https from "https";

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const apiKey = "API_KEY_HERE";
  const apiUrl = 'BASE_SERVER_URL_HERE';
  const path = '/payments/cron-api';

  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    path: path,
    headers: {
      'Authorization': apiKey
    }
  };

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const req = https.request(apiUrl + path, options, (res) => {
      let data = '';

      res.on('data', (chunk) => {
        data += chunk;
      });

      res.on('end', () => {
        console.log('Response Status:', res.statusCode);
        console.log('Response Data:', data);
        resolve(data);
      });
    });

    req.on('error', (error) => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      reject(error);
    });

    req.end();
  });
};
```

# Note on testing external frontend

- Can test external frontend manually by calling the get subscription page api along with the vendor , vendorclient and apikeys. Simply reseed the database and call the get all vendor clients api to get the the details, then input into the subscription page api
